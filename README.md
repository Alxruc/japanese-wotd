# japanese-wotd

A browser extension that gives you a new Japanese word daily.

The Japanese words were pulled from http://www17408ui.sakura.ne.jp/tatsum/database.html from the general learners vocabulary list [VDLJ_Ver1_0_General-Learners.xlsx](http://www17408ui.sakura.ne.jp/tatsum/database/VDLJ_Ver1_0_General-Learners.xlsx) and were turned into a txt file using Python.

As it is currently unsigned it can only be tested by adding it as a temporary addon. For example for Firefox:
- Clone directory
- Go to about:debugging
- Navigate to "This Firefox"
- Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
- Add file from directory
